### Hi there, I'm Rick Booth. You can find me on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/rixcy) ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a full stack developer for [Progression](https://progressionapp.com) helping build out and integrate a design system using React/TypeScript.

#### Tools and Technologies

I enjoy working with React and TypeScript building anything from component libraries to full stack SaaS apps. I do the majority of my coding directly in the terminal with help from Vim, Tmux, FZF and other great tools.

#### Projects

- **[rickbooth.me](https://rickbooth.me)** - My current website built using Dracula UI
- **[nextjs-starter](https://github.com/Rixcy/nextjs-starter)** - A starter project with powerful functionality like StoryBook, TypeScript, TailwindCSS etc. built in
- **[components](https://components.rixcy.website)** - A library of React/TypeScript components styled using TailwindCSS with accessibility and performance in mind.
